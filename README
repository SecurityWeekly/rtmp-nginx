Docker container for running NGINX as an RTMP proxy for streaming video to multiple services. Complete with SSL and authentication.


You will need to build your own .env file and fill out all of the values (including generating SSL certs):

NGINX_HTTP_PORT=8080
NGINX_HTTPS_PORT=8443
NGINX_SERVERNAME=[FQDN or server name]
NGINX_ROOT=/var/www/html
NGINX_RTMP_PORT=1935
RTMP1_URL=[YouTube or other stream URL]
RTMP1_KEY=[Your stream key, keep this secret!]
RTMP2_URL=[Second streaming service URL]
RTMP2_KEY=[Second streaming service key]
RTMP_PASS=[A string that will be the password for OBS or other software]
SSL_CERT_PATH=/etc/ssl/fullchain.pem
SSL_KEY_PATH=/etc/ssl/privkey.pem

In OBS, go to settings -> stream:

Service = Custom...
Server = rtmp://[hostname or IP]/live
Stream Key = streamer?pwd=[Your Password]
